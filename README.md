* Function template: reduces duplicated code.
    * template <typename T> : is a placeholder for an item
    * template <typename T> & void f1(T a){}; are in joint a template
    * These functions can be called with any type of argument. The only requirement is that the two arguments must have the same type and must support all the comparison operators.
    * Note on reference
